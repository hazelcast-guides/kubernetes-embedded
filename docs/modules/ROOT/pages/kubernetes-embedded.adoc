:description: Deploy an application with embedded Hazelcast into a Kubernetes cluster.

{description}

== Context

Hazelcast instances from each application replica will all automatically discover themselves and form one consistent Hazelcast cluster. Thanks to https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/tree/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/kubernetes[Hazelcast Kubernetes discovery plugin], there is no static configuration needed.

== Before you Begin

- https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker] (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[Docker for Desktop] is good enough)
- https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes] cluster (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[Docker for Desktop] or https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/[Minikube] is good enough)
- https://git-scm.com/[Git]
- JDK 1.8+
- Apache Maven 3.2+

== Create an Application

You can embed Hazelcast into any JVM-based application and use any web framework you want. As an sample for this tutorial, use the application from the xref:hazelcast-embedded-springboot.adoc[] tutorial. To download it, execute the following command.

----
git clone https://github.com/hazelcast-guides/hazelcast-embedded-springboot.git
----

[TIP]
====
You can use any other JVM-based application framework, but please make sure your project includes a dependency to '`hazelcast:hazelcast:${hazelcast.version}`' (or '`hazelcast:hazelcast-spring:${hazelcast.version}`').
====

== Use Hazelcast Kubernetes Configuration

Hazelcast provides the dedicated https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/tree/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/kubernetes[Hazelcast Kubernetes plugin] which allows to automatically form Hazelcast cluster in the Kubernetes environment. To enabled it, use the following Hazelcast configuration.

[source, yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  network:
    join:
      multicast:
        enabled: false
      kubernetes:
        enabled: true
----

To include this file inside your Spring Boot project, copy it into `hazelcast-embedded-springboot/src/resources/`.

----
cp hazelcast.yaml hazelcast-embedded-springboot/src/main/resources/
----

Now, you can build the project with the following command.

----
mvn package -f hazelcast-embedded-springboot/pom.xml
----

As an output, the JAR file with our application should be created at `hazelcast-embedded-springboot/target/*.jar`.

== Containerize the Application

To containerize the application, you need to have Docker installed. Then, you can use the following `Dockerfile`.

[source, dockerfile]
----
FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine
COPY hazelcast-embedded-springboot/target/*.jar app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","app.jar"]
----

In order to build the Docker image, run the following command.

----
docker build -t hazelcastguides/hazelcast-embedded-kubernetes .
----

If you build the image by yourself, then you need to use your Docker Hub account instead of `hazelcastguides`. Then, you can push the image into your Docker Hub registry with the following command.

----
docker push hazelcastguides/hazelcast-embedded-kubernetes
----

If you want to use your image in the following steps, please also make sure your Docker Hub registry is public. However, for the purpose of this guide, you can use the already built `hazelcastguides/hazelcast-embedded-kubernetes` Docker image.


== Configure RBAC

https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/tree/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/kubernetes[Hazelcast Kubernetes discovery plugin] makes calls to Kubernetes API to provide automatic member discovery. Therefore, it needs to have specific ClusterRole rules granted. You can apply the minimal RBAC configuration (for the `default` service account in the `default` namespace) with the following command.

----
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/master/kubernetes-rbac.yaml
----

Note that:

- If you use service account other than `default` or namespace other than `default`, you need to modify https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/master/kubernetes-rbac.yaml
- If your Kubernetes cluster does not use RBAC, you can skip the whole "Configure RBAC" step

== Deploy Application to Kubernetes

Assuming you have a running Kubernetes cluster, you can run the following commands to deploy your application and scale it to 2 replicas.

----
kubectl create deployment my-app --image=hazelcastguides/hazelcast-embedded-kubernetes
kubectl scale deployment my-app --replicas=2
----

Now, if you look into created pods, you should see two replicas of your application.

----
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
my-app-86df8b785f-4x9pj   1/1     Running   0          81s
my-app-86df8b785f-h926d   1/1     Running   0          73s
----

In your application logs, you should see that embedded Hazelcast instances formed one cluster together.

----
$ kubectl logs pod/my-app-86df8b785f-4x9pj
...
Members {size:2, ver:2} [
        Member [10.24.1.10]:5701 - a7eb36b6-6d86-4d26-8eb6-47986e46d055 this
        Member [10.24.2.6]:5701 - 9994d6c6-d271-4ddd-9aa9-1ac4767c1a73
]
----

== Test the Application

To test that the application works correctly, you can create a Kubernetes service which load balances the traffic to one of the application replicas.

----
kubectl create service clusterip my-app --tcp=8080:8080
----

Then, to be able to make calls from your local machine, you can use `port-forward`.

----
kubectl port-forward service/my-app 8080:8080
----

Finally, you can make a REST calls to your application.

----
$ curl --data "key=key1&value=hazelcast" "localhost:8080/put"
{"value":"hazelcast"}
$ curl "localhost:8080/get?key=key1"
{"value":"hazelcast"}

----

== Tear Down the Deployment

To delete all Kubernetes resources you created, run the following command.

----
kubectl delete deployment/my-app service/my-app
----
